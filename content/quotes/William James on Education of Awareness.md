The faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention, over and over again, is the very root of judgment, character, and will. ... An education which should improve this faculty would be the education par excellence. - Willian James

Related: An education that uses contemplative training to clear away the mental debris that constantly flows through our consciousness and interferes with our direct apprehension of our situation and of our lives, one that promotes the development of our immediate intuitive senses, would be, to paraphrase James, the education par excellence. - *From [Critical Subjectivity and the Phenomenology of Contemplative Studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krpG9q4_JQE)*
