quote: ...I want to retain what the quiet reveals, the small voices whose whispers can be heard only when everything falls silent.
---
I want to let something break in me, some dam that has been shoring up this shamefully atavistic sense of the magic behind all things, the tingle of intelligence that was always waiting for me when I came to tap in. I want to feel that raw, elemental awe that my ancestors felt, rather than my tame, explained modern version. I want to prise open the confines of my skull and let in a flood of light and air and mystery... I want to retain what the quiet reveals, the small voices whose whispers can be heard only when everything falls silent. - Katherine May
