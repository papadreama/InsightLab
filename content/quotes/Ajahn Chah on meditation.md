quote: If you haven't wept deeply, you haven't begun to meditate.
---
Do not try to become anything.  
Do not make yourself into anything.  
Do not be a meditator.  
Do not become enlightened.  
When you sit, let it be.  
When you walk, let it be.  
Grasp at nothing.  
Resist nothing.  
If you haven't wept deeply, you haven't begun to meditate.  - Ajahn Chah
