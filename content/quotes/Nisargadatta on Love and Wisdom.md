quote: Love says, ‘I am everything.’ Wisdom says, ‘I am nothing.’ Between these two my life flows.

Look how my thumb and forefinger touch. When I identify with my forefinger I am the feeler and the thumb the object that I experience. Reverse the identification and I am the thumb, feeling this forefinger as an object. I find that somehow by shifting the focus of attention I become the very thing I look at…I call this capacity of entering other focal points of consciousness love. You may give it any name you like. 

**Love says, ‘I am everything.’ Wisdom says, ‘I am nothing.’ Between these two my life flows.**
