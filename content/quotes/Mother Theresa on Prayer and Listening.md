Dan Rather, CBS television interviewer, asked Mother Teresa of Calcutta: “When you pray, what do you say to God?”  

**Teresa:** I don’t say anything, I listen.  
**Rather:** Well okay … when God speaks to you, then, what does he say?  
**Teresa:** He doesn’t say anything. He listens. … And if you don’t understand that, I can’t explain it to you.
