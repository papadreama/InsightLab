quote: ...For it is in giving that we receive,   it is in forgiving that we are forgiven,   and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.

Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:  
where there is hatred, let me sow love;  
where there is injury, pardon;  
where there is doubt, faith;  
where there is despair, hope;  
where there is darkness, light;  
where there is sadness, joy.   
  
O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek  
to be consoled as to console,  
to be understood as to understand,  
to be loved as to love.  
For it is in giving that we receive,   
it is in forgiving that we are forgiven,   
and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.  
Amen.
