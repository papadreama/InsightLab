According to legend, Prometheus brought man fire, in order to liberate him from control by nature. Man at this point of history has enslaved himself to the very fire that was to liberate him. Man today, wearing the mask of a giant, has become a weak, helpless being dependent on the machines *he* made, and hence on the leaders who guarantee the proper functioning of the society that produces the machines, dependent on a well-functioning business, frightened to death of losing all the props, of being "a man without rank and without title," of just being, of being challenged by the question "Who am I?"
