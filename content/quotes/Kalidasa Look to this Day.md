Look to this Day,  
for it is Life â€“ the very Life of Life.  
In its brief course lie all the verities  
and realities of your existence:  
the Bliss of Growth,  
the Glory of Action,  
the Splendor of Beauty.  

For yesterday is already a dream  
and tomorrow is only a vision;  
but today, well-lived,  
makes every yesterday a dream of happiness  
and every tomorrow a vision of hope.  
Look well, therefore, to this Day.  
Such is the salutation of the Dawn.
