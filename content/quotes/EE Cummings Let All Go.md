let it go – the  
smashed word broken  
open vow or  
the oath cracked length  
wise – let it go it  
was sworn to  
go

let them go – the  
truthful liars and  
the false fair friends  
and the boths and  
neithers – you must let them go they  
were born  
to go

let all go – the  
big small middling  
tall bigger really  
the biggest and all  
things – let all go  
dear

so comes love
