Meditation is not what you think. You sit in absolute silence and your mind starts re-watching all your movies. During this process, you become so familiar with the scenarios you keep in your life that you become tired of them. Then you understand that the person you think you are is nothing but a complicated scenario where you spend most of your energy. After further examination, you’ll discover that your personality disgusts you. And that’s because it’s not really you. - Leonard Cohen
