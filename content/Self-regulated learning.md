# Self-regulated Learning
### Three Phases 
Self-regulated learning models conceptualize a cyclic process of three phases:
1. **Pre-action phase**: analyzing situational demands, setting goals, building motivation, planning
2. **Action phase**: engaging in the task at hand, applying cognitive learning strategies
3. **Post-action phase**: self-reflection phase reflecting on learning outcomes, regulating negative emotions, etc.
