> [!abstract] Overview
> In this chapter, we are going to learn about limits. Limits serve as the foundation for almost everything we do in calculus. We can use limits to compute slopes of tangent lines, areas of complex shapes, volumes of 3D solids, lengths of plane curves, work, and much more.
> 
> Our exploration of limits will begin with an intuitive approach. Then, we'll formalize the limit concept with a more rigorous definition and accompanying notation.
