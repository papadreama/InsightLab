# Analysis of Functions

{{< hint "info" >}}

In this section, we are going to explore, in greater depth, what the first and second derivatives tell us about a function. In other words, we'll use $f'$ and $f''$ to analyze the behavior of $f$. The short answer is that $f'$ tells us where $f$ is increasing and decreasing, while $f''$ tells us where $f$ is concave up and concave down. These concepts pave the way to *optimization* - determining where a function has peaks and valleys, maxima and minima.

## Increasing/Decreasing

What do we mean when we say that $f$ is *increasing*? It might seem like a silly question with a really obvious answer. But the question is really asking whether we can express our intuition in a mathematically 

## Looking Back at the Definition of the Derivative

Recall that to compute the *instantaneous rate of change* of $f$ at $x = a$, we evaluate the following limit: 

$$
f'(a) = \lim_{b \to a} \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
$$
