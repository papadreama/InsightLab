# Derivatives

The motivating question for this chapter is "given a function, $f$, how do I compute the slope of the line tangent to its graph at $x = a$?" As it turns out, limits give us the answer. Once we have that answer, we'll be able to apply it to all sorts of applications, especially those that involve rates of change. 
 
First, we'll use limits to define the derivative. The derivative of a function, usually written $f'$, is like a helper function. When we evaluate $f'(a)$ it tells us things about $f$ at $x = a$. We'll spend much of this chapter figuring out the derivatives of the main categories of functions: polynomials, trig functions, exponentials, logs, and inverse trig functions, as well as how to put them together with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and composition.
