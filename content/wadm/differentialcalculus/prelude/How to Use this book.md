## Some background


When we read a textbook (or any book we're trying to learn practical skills from), it has to be an engaged form of reading. Studies like [this one](https://pubs.nctm.org/view/journals/jrme/43/4/article-p358.xml) have shown that there's a big difference in how the eyes of an expert move when reading a mathematical proof as compared with a novice. The expert's eyes dart back and forth all over the page as they read, checking and rechecking every line as they go. 

If we're trying to learn from a book, we can't expect to pick it up, read some stuff, and then be able to do all the things we just read about. Think of it this way: 

> I might learn some useful tricks by watching my favorite guitarist play guitar or my favorite tennis player play tennis, but if I don't pick up the guitar or get on the court and try to emulate those things myself, I'm never going to get any better. **I need the feedback of failing to do the thing I want to do in order to get better.**

This brings me to another point. 

## Reading vs. Videos
One of the issues with *watching* someone explain something, is that it can impart a [false sense of understanding/expertise](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797617740646). The very popular channel, Veritasium, did a great video [on the effectiveness of science education videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8). Feeling like we understand something is a lot more pleasant than feeling like we don't understand something. As a result, we tend to choose learning strategies that feel good but aren't necessarily the most effective ways of doing things. None of this is to say that watching videos about math and science on YouTube and other platforms is a bad thing. It's a great way to get inspired and motivated or introduced to new topics. But, it's not a substitute working through problems and concepts on our own as a way of challenging our understanding over and over. 

On that note, one of the most common frustrations I hear from students is, "I get what you're saying in class and can follow along as you solve problems, but when I sit to do it myself, I get stuck." While I do my best to explain concepts and problem-solving as best as I can, the most important and productive time we have in class is when I give you time to try solving problems on your own. Even if you don't get the answer (or especially if you don't get the answer), that's when the real learning happens. Again, the point is we have to **do** to learn from what we read, watch, and hear. 

## Getting to the point
I hope that this resource will help you bridge the theoretical side of calculus with the practical tasks of solving problems and modeling real-life situations with the tools calculus provides. To that end...

* I've embedded the exercises in the text, rather than piling them all at the end of each section. 
* As you work through each section, try to do each exercise. 
* Read line by line and work along line by line. 
* For the exercises, before you hit the `solution` button, be really sure you've given it your all. 
* If you've gotten stuck and haven't started from scratch a few times, wait to view the solution. After you've viewed the solution, close it and try to recreate it yourself. 
* [Interleaved practice](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED557355.pdf) - doing problems on various topics - has been shown to be more effective than doing blocks of problems on the same material. Eventually, I plan to build a quiz generator to help you test yourself on multiple sections at once. For now, go to the [Drexel Calculus Homepage](https://www.math.drexel.edu/classes/Calculus/index.html), open the problem sets from the two or three most recent topics, and bounce back and forth between them.
