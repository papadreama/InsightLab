> [!abstract] Overview
> Rapid logging is a core part of the [Bullet Journal Method](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq/what-is-the-bullet-journal-method) by Ryder Carol. Though the internet is filled with bullet journal content about fancy hand-lettering and complicated organizational systems, at it's core the bullet journal method is a "*mindfulness practice disguised as a productivity tool.*" 

## The basics
Rather than doing traditional, long-form journaling, with rapid logging one uses simple bullets to capture tasks, ideas, events, and moods throughout the day. The key is reflection. By taking quick notes throughout the day, every day, we have ample data on not just what we do, but also how we feel. We can then reflect daily, weekly, or monthly (as we see fit) to gain perspective on how our efforts are lining up with our values. 

These are the bullets I've adopted: 

> [!note] My Bullets
>  `â€¢` tasks
>  `-` notes/ideas/thoughts
>  `o` events
>  ` =` moods 

The simpler the better!
