> [!abstract] Overview
> Since 2016, I've taught a number of sources, workshops, and summer camps on the intersections of mathematics and music. In my experience, math can illuminate a lot about how we experience and compose music. More recently, I've been incorporating coding into this curriculum, using a wonderful platform called [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net). The lecture notes included here include code samples.
