Getting started is always a challenge - putting down those first words, that first brush stroke, sitting down to meditate, starting a new workout plan. For me, it's when the work is personal, when I feel most vulnerable, that the blank page overwhelms me. Writing like this, for example, is a real slog. 

The advice in most of the great books on writing and other creative work all say the same thing: just get started. In *[Bird by Bird](https://a.co/d/fpLmnbC),* Anne Lamott encourages us to embrace the "shitty first draft." In *[The Artist's Way](https://a.co/d/6XfbUAm)* by Julia Cameron and *[Writing Down the Bones](https://a.co/d/46P9tA7)* by Natalie Goldberg, the authors suggest free-writing as a way to start overcoming the blank page; make a practice of writing freely, without editing, without pausing or stopping, in a stream of consciousness. 

I genuinely believe that this kind of advice is excellent. But, for me, free-writing became more of a [[Mindfulness|mindfulness]] exercise in that it seemed to supported and supplement my meditation practice more than my creative output.[^1] That said, I'm very open to the fact that the fruits of a practice like free-writing might just take a while to ripen in my case. More recently, I've been exploring, and finally experimenting with, two related ideas: digital gardens and learning in public. 

Learning in public is something I first heard about from [Nicole van der Hoeven](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Learning+in+public). It's the idea that, especially with digital media, it's very easy to *show your work,* as [Austin Kleon puts it.](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/) Even before starting the "shitty first draft," the notes, outlines, research, and insights we have might be of value to others in and of themselves. Why not share them? One way of sharing them is to keep a public digital garden of notes. 

The idea of a [[Digital Gardens|digital garden]] goes back to the early days of the internet. With the internet came the advent of he hyperlink. The ability to add links throughout a written document opened up new, nonlinear options for communicating ideas through text. Today, this seems obvious. We've all fallen down [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) rabbit holes, jumping from one topic to the next. But in the 1990s, this was new territory. 

One of the earliest instances of the gardening analogy was Mark Bernstein's essay, [The Hypertext Garden](https://www.eastgate.com/garden/Introduction.html). He writes: 

> Unplanned hypertext sprawl is wilderness: complex and interesting, but uninviting.Â [Interesting things await us](https://www.eastgate.com/garden/Rigid_design.html) in the thickets, but we may be reluctant to plough through the brush, subject to thorns and mosquitoes.

I've been keeping a personal digital garden of interconnected notes in [[Markdown|markdown format]] for a couple of years, using the app [[Obsidian]]. In preparing for an upcoming [[A Course on Contemplative Practices|course on contemplative practices]], I used this system to organize research, write assignments, prepare lecture notes, and structure the course. It dawned on me that I might as well just share it just as it is - as a series of interconnected notes, with a table of contents that only formed over time. 

Working in this way, with atomized notes, each relating to a single idea, I found I could write with far greater ease than if I considered the project as a whole. The table of contents came together in time, and continues to evolve. 

An image can only begin to form once we start putting paint to canvas. If I had to identify a reason for my struggle to translate free-writing into completed writing, it's that I was still trying to take a top-down approach when it came time to write. That works for some. For me, the bottom-up approach works much better. It feels like "starting close in," as [David Whyte writes] in a poem by the same name: 

> Start close in,   
> don't take the second step  
> or the third,  
> start with the first  
> thing  
> close in,  
> the step  
> you don't want to take.

This site is a result of this experiment with showing my work, planting seeds in a digital garden, and starting close in. I hope it my be of some value to you.
