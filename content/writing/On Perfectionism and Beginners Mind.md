In my ongoing, quarrelsome relationship with perfectionism, I've found it useful to experiment with practices and inquiries that bring forth what Shunryu Suzuki called beginner's mind. 

>  In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities. In the expert's mind there are few - Suzuki Roshi

The beginner's mind is a space of possibilities. It is open and curious and less restrained by conceptual certainty than the so-called expert's mind. Once we arrive at conceptual certainty, the space of possible interpretations and solutions to our problems and questions can easily get lost. 

Uncertainty is uncomfortable. We like having answers, and we carry little digital oracles in our pockets that promise to answer all our questions. This leaves less space for mystery and uncertainty, which can be invitations to explore new horizons within ourselves, so long as we befriend them with curiosity and openness. In this vein, David Whyte reminds us that questions have the power to shape us as much by the asking as by the answering: 

> The marvelous thing about a good question is that it shapes our identity as much by the asking as it does by the answering.

In exploring the ways in which perfectionism shows up for me, I've brought this spirit of befriending uncertainty to bear. Perfectionism, for me, takes two main forms. The first is what Steven Pressfield calls *resistance*. It's the feeling of starting a blank page or the blank canvas, paralyzed by the fear that what comes out won't be any good. He urges us to consider the idea that this particular form of fear is actually an indication that we're onto something meaningful. If it weren't meaningful, it wouldn't be scary. 

> Resistance is experienced as fear; the degree of fear equates to the strength of Resistance. Therefore the more fear we feel about a specific enterprise, the more certain we can be that that enterprise is important to us and to the growth of our soul. That's why we feel so much Resistance. If it meant nothing to us, there'd be no Resistance. - Steven Pressfield,Â *The War of Art*

I encounter a lot of resistance when working on creative projects that are personal or that lack external constraints. If I'm writing content for a course I'm teaching, working on a curriculum, or co-authoring an article, the norms, constraints, and clear markers of success serve as guardrails. But, writing like this - creative, personal, or poetic - is different. In my professional writing, embodying the role of the professional creates a sense of safety. It isn't me who becomes vulnerable to critique; it's this role I'm playing.

It's counterintuitive, but this form of resistance is *expert's mind* creeping in. As soon as an idea begins to take shape, and I'm about to put words on the page, the expert's mind expresses a premonition: "I can tell this isn't going to be very good. Stop now." It reminds me of a great quote by Ira Glass on creative work. He says that we get into creative work because we have good taste, but it takes a really long time for our work to catch up to our taste. The expert's mind distorts taste into forms of self-judgement, and it does so with unfettered scrutiny and haste.

One practice that's been incredibly helpful, and that I find to be a beautiful expression of beginner's mind, is [*morning pages*](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/). This is a practice that Julia Cameron writes about in *The Artist's Way*. Every morning, you sit down and write three pages, longhand. This is to be done without stopping, without editing, without any regard for what comes out whatsoever. It's a unencumbered stream of consciousness. 

Morning pages is an emancipatory practice of letting go of control and perfectionistic self-judgement. It is a practice of beginner's mind in which there's no right or wrong, good or bad. On a good day, it becomes an interesting linguistic flow state free from conceptual framing. Not every morning pages session is like that, of course, but that's also part of the practice: letting go of expectations. And once there's writing on the page, it becomes possible to stand back and ask, "what is beckoning to be further explored?"

The second form of perfectionism I've been working with is the paralysis that keeps me from sharing what I create.  There's an implicit question feeding this paralysis: "What if I put this out there and everyone doesn't love it?" This kind of question, in my experience, is emblematic of perfectionism. It's a question the inner critic (resistance) asks only as a rhetorical question. To ask that question with openness and genuine curiosity would be to acknowledge the possibility that absolutely nothing will happen if "everyone doesn't love it." 

Tiago Forte wrote a great [piece about the life-changing nature of a creative project](https://fortelabs.com/blog/a-single-creative-project-can-change-the-trajectory-of-your-life/). In it, he suggests that a creative project is, for him, an act of service. The perfectionistic retort is, "this isn't good enough to be of service to anyone. Who am I to offer advice?" But this retort still centers the self. Tiago's attitude toward creativity is that it is fundamentally a form of service to others. He suggests that creativity is a "gift to be given away." Artists can become caught up in perfectionism and preciousness, both of which become obstacles to our creativity. All forms of resistance are the self-limiting inner voice that tells us we aren't enough, we have nothing worth saying, we aren't ready yet. Rather than fixating on perfect expression, Tiago suggests an attitude of responsibility to others. If we have knowledge, skills, talents, resources, or ideas that might alleviate the suffering of another human being, it is our responsibility to offer them. 

To reorient in this way is to ask a good question and be shaped by it: "What if I share this an even one person gets something out of it?" There's no need to answer.
