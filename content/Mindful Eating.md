## Overview
This is a practice often used early on in [Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction](https://www.ummhealth.org/center-mindfulness) programs. It is usually done with a raisin, but any simple food will do. 

### Why Do It?
Eating is something we do multiple times a day. In our fast-paced lives, we often eat quickly, rushing into the next moment, or we're eating while distracted by our devices. Of course, a social meal is a great way to connect, where we might not be savoring every bite on account of good conversation with friends and family. But, even in those moments, practicing a bit of mindfulness can help us be more present for those we're with. 

Any activity we have to do daily is a great opportunity to practice mindfulness (brushing our teeth, washing dishes, cooking, walking, etc.) What makes mindful eating practice uniquely beneficial is that it can involve all our senses. We taste and smell our food, we see it and touch it, and even though we might not think of hearing our food often, there's the sound of food sizzling or the sound of cutting and chewing. A feast for the senses!

By slowing down, and letting all our senses take in a very simple morsel of food, we can gain new appreciation not just for our food, but also for our sense. 

## Instructions

1. Hold your raisin either between your fingers or in the palm of your hand. Imagine it your first time seeing a raisin - hopefully it's your first time seeing this particular raisin. 
2. Look closely at it. Repeat the [[Novel Observations of Everyday Experiences|novel observations exercise]] and really pay attention to what you see: ridges, light and shadow, colors, textures. 
3. Next explore the texture of the raisin. Roll it around between your fingers. Tap it. Squish it. You can try this with your eyes closed. 
4. Now hold the raisin under your nose. What do you smell? Notice if anything is happening in your mouth or stomach. 
5. Continue to roll your raisin between your finger tips as you hold it up to your ear. Do you hear anything?
6. Next, gently place the raisin in your mouth, but don't chew yet. Notice what happens in your mind and body with the raisin sitting in your mouth. 
7. Finally, start to chew your raisin slowly and deliberately, noticing what the experience is like. Before swallowing it, notice the bare sensations of taste and texture. 
8. Notice the urge to swallow your raisin before you actually swallow. 
9. What happens after you've swallowed the raisin? What's it feel like in your body? Is there an urge to eat another? What does that urge feel like, and where do you feel it?
