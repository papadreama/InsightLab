## Overview

> [!todo] Course Materials
> [[Schedule for Ten Week Contemplative Studies Course|Here's the schedule]] for the ten-week version of this course I'll be teaching Fall 2024. You can also view the [[Contemplative Studies Course Syllabus|full syllabus here]]. 

This course is designed for students to explore and develop a personal ecology of contemplative practices aimed at integrating their academic and professional journeys with their personal values and aspirations. Through a comprehensive curriculum that blends theory, practice, and reflection, students will critically examine their values, motivations, mental models, and habits of mind. 

Each week, we will focus on different [[contemplative practices]], their historical contexts, theoretical foundations, underlying philosophies, and practical applications in daily life. Our readings will include ancient and modern manuals of practice coupled with scientific literature on the benefits of these practices, as well as poetry and selected readings from psychology and philosophy. Students will be encouraged to experiment with [[meditation]], [[journaling]], creative expression, and intentional dialogue as they deepen their self-understanding and define a personal vision of [[self-actualization]].

## Structure + Aim
This course is broken down into ten modules, each containing a few core ideas/concepts, in-class activities and discussions, and home practices. The readings and other media I've included throughout are there to support our explorations by providing useful language, scientific foundations, historical context, and useful frameworks. 

This doesn't mean that we're here to learn facts and analyze texts as we might in a traditional literature or philosophy course. This course is about you, and the most important material is your unique, subjective experience. If something you read or watch sparks something in you, sheds light on an aspect of your life that feels interesting or challenging or helpful, or prompts a meaningful reflection, great! If not, then feel free to let it go. 

I hope that these ideas and practices will serve as tools that you can bring to bear on your pursuit of self-knowledge. In my experience, there's great delight in finding a phrase or story or image that reveals something I felt I knew all along.
