## Idea
- Example from learning language
	- Study words for twenty minutes or so
	- Do something else for fifteen minutes to get mind off of the reading
	- Come back to desk and try to remember as many words as possible without opening the textbook
		- Remember everything you can
	- Open the textbook and look for what you missed
	- *This is one round of free recall*
