In this course, I aim to present a **laboratory of contemplative practices** with which we can conduct a *science of the subjective.* Though *science* usually refers to the systematic study of the natural world (the world we might take to be *outside* our minds) through observation, experimentation, and hypothesis testing, we can apply a similarly systematic approach to analyzing our subjective experience of both ourselves and the world. This is how I like to think about contemplative practices: they are methods of observation and experimentation applied to our first-person experiences. 

One of the simplest, though not necessarily easiest, such tests is to simply sit quietly and observe that machinations of our mind. As [one meditation teacher](https://www.buddhistinquiry.org/article/a-simple-turning-in-place-forty-years-in-the-dharma/) put it,

Easier said than done! As the famous mathematician Blaise Pascal put it, "“All of humanity's problems, stem from man's **inability to sit quietly in a room alone**.” When we first try to sit and observe the mind, we notice that it isn't so easy. It's as if the mind has a mind of its own. 

Fortunately, many of the practices we'll be experimenting with have been in use for thousands of years. Modern psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience have shed a lot of light on how and why those practices work and the sorts of changes they can catalyze in the practitioner. 

Think of the various contemplative practices you'll encounter here like the tools in a laboratory. The tools are just the tools. What we're most often interested in when we conduct experiments is the raw material on which we experiment, not the tools we use to conduct those experiments. In the case of contemplative practices, the raw material on which you're experimenting is your own subjective experience. 

Some of these practices might yield really powerful insights. Some might not. Give each one a fair shot, but remember that the aim is self-knowledge: we're here to gain insight into what makes us tick, what drives us, what holds us back, what moves us. 

> DISCLAIMER: Though many of the readings and practices in this course come from spiritual/religious traditions, our approach will be entirely empirical and experiential. In the spirit of [[Beginner's Mind|beginner's mind]], the expectation is that you don't take anything at face value, let alone *believe* any of the theoretical foundations or scientific evidence for these practices. Each time we engage in a contemplative practice, we want to simply notice what is present in our experience, be that physical, mental, emotional, or otherwise. Any beliefs or doubts that bubble up become part of the practice of observation.
