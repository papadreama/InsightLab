## Notes
- Think of information as a funnel
	- raw --> summary --> processed --> new
- It's too easy to get lost in consuming content
	- Delay gratification or let yourself off the hook for *not* taking notes
- Inbox zero is a myth!
	- But maybe pick a subset of all inboxes to zero out regularly
- Get good at search
	- E.g., `line:("old school")` will look for notes with a line containing "old school"
		- Use `-` to omit directories
	- Native queries
		- `query` 
- Look in the map for orphan notes!
