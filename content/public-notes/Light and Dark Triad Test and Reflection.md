## Overview
The dark triad characterizes orientations and behaviors that are associated with socially undesirable outcomes. The three primary traits in the dark triad are **Machiavellianism,** **Grandiose Narcissism[^narcissism],** and **Psychopathy.** Machiavellianism refers to the willingness to deceive and manipulate to get one's way (at any cost). Grandiose narcissism is a pattern of inflated self-importance, feelings of superiority, and the need to be admired by others. Psychopathy is characterized by the absence of empathy, callousness, and detachment. 

By contrast, the light triad traits are **Kantianism,** **Humanism,** and **Faith in Humanity.** Kantianism serves as the counterpart to Machiavellianism. The philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote about the importance of treating people as ends unto themselves: 

> Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.

Notice that Kant is not saying that we can't get something out of our relationships. A friend can help us get a job. A boss can grant us a promotion. But, we should *never* treat another human being solely as a means to an end, but always as ends unto themselves. 

Completing the triad, humanism refers to recognizing and valuing the innate dignity and worth of every individual, while faith in humanity refers to the belief that humans are fundamentally good. 

Note that most of us have both light triad and dark triad traits, that each is on a spectrum, that we might move between these traits depending on context, and that our personalities can change over time.
