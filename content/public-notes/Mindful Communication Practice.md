### Mindful Communication Exercise: "What Matters Most to You?"

**Objective:**  
To cultivate deep listening, empathy, and awareness through mindful communication. Students will practice presence and reflective listening while sharing and receiving thoughts on the question, "What matters most to you?"

#### **1. Introduction to Mindful Communication (10 minutes)**  
- **Purpose:** The purpose of this exercise is to apply the mindfulness we've been cultivating in observing our own thoughts, feelings, and sensory experience to one-on-one conversation.  
- **Key Concepts:**  
   - **Mindful Listening:** Being fully present with the speaker without planning your response or judging.  
   - **Mindful Speaking:** Speaking honestly and authentically, with awareness of how your words land for others.  
   - **Non-judgment and Compassion:** Approaching the conversation with an open heart, free from assumptions or reactions.  
- **Guidelines for Practice:**  
   - Listen without interrupting.  
   - Avoid thinking about how you’ll respond while the other person is talking.  
   - Acknowledge with a nod or a simple “thank you” instead of offering advice or opinions, but try to keep these to a minimum.



#### **2. Pairing Up and Setting Intention (5 minutes)**  
- **Instructions:** Pair up and face one another.
- **Reflect on your Intention** to sit silently, without judgment or commentary, while the other person speaks. 



#### **3. The Prompt: "What Matters Most to You?" (7 minutes total; ~3 minutes per speaker)**  
- **Round 1:** Partner A answers the prompt while Partner B listens mindfully.  
   - The speaker should explore their thoughts and feelings openly.  
   - The listener maintains soft eye contact, nodding or acknowledging with presence but without verbal response or interruption.  
- **Round 2:** Switch roles. Partner B answers the prompt, and Partner A listens.  



#### **4. Reflective Sharing and Feedback**  
- **Silent Reflection (2 minutes):** Ask students to take a moment in silence to reflect on their experience as both the speaker and the listener.  
- **Discussion:**  
   - **Guiding Questions:**  
      - How did it feel to be fully listened to?  
      - What was challenging about listening without responding? 
      - Did anything unexpected arise during the exercise?  




#### **5. Group Debrief (10 minutes)**  
- **Class Discussion:**  
   - How might mindful communication change our relationships with others?  
   - How can we bring these principles into daily life, both in personal and professional contexts?  
- **Closing Remarks:** Reinforce the value of presence and compassion in communication as tools for building deeper connections and promoting understanding.


#### **6. Closing Meditation (5 minutes)**  
- Guide a short meditation focusing on gratitude for the opportunity to listen and be heard. Invite students to appreciate their partner’s willingness to share and their own capacity for presence.
