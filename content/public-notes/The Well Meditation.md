This meditation is an *inquiry* or *self-inquiry* practice. We drop a question into our meditation, like dropping a pebble down a well. It's a little like Zen [[Koan Practice|koan practice]]. 

To begin, we sit quietly to settle in. We might focus on the breath or some other anchor for a few moments. 


- Invite to settle in
- Give a moment to pay attention to the breath and or body
- Imagine leaning over edge of a well with a pebble in hand
	- We're going to work with a question: Why are you hear?
	- You hold it out over the well and drop it in
	- You hear it splash
	- What comes up for you in that moment - the moment of the splash
	- Leave that answer and watch the pebble continue falling down
	- It lands on a ledge - suspended
	- Again, what brings you here
	- It teeters and continues to fall
	- When the pebble hits the bottom, is there and answer to the question: what brings you here...?
		- This time, put your answer on the shelf and return to the feeling of the breath or anchor
