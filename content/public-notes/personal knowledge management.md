## Overview

*Personal Knowledge Management* generally refers to the processes one uses to collect, store, classify, organize, and retrieve [[knowledge]], as well as the ways those processes might support one's work or personal endeavors. Most PKM systems take a bottom-up approach, in which connections between notes and resources emerge as one's library of notes grows. 

## Examples

### Analog

- The [[Zettelkasten Method]] is an analog PKM system. developed by the prolific German sociologist [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann). 
- Another classic example is the [[commonplace book]] used by thinkers throughout history, like Thomas Jefferson, Isaac Newton, Virginia Woolf, and John Milton. 
- The [[Bullet Journal Method]] is a "[[Mindfulness]] practice disguised as a productivity system," which can certainly serve as a PKM.
