I have been teaching college-level mathematics since 2010. During that time, I also completed a doctorate in education and am currently completing a graduate certificate in applied mindfulness. Outside of the standard math courses I teach, I have developed interdisciplinary courses on math + music and math + politics. More recently, Iâ€™ve been working on contemplative curricula that incorporate philosophy, creativity, and mindfulness to explore what it means to live a good life.
