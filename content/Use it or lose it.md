## Notes
### Reasons we don't make stuff
- [[Imposter syndrome]] 
	- Looking stupid
- What is this for?
	- "I'll map out the next three years so I have a clear purpose..."
- It's not polished enough...
#### Antidote...Learn. In. Public.
- "Work with the garage door up."
- "Document, don't create."
	- We all have a story to tell. Think of it as documenting, not publishing.
	- [ ] [Austin Kleon's book *Show Your Work*](https://a.co/d/hyyF1CO) #toread 
- We can be guides and not gurus.
### Process
#### Step 1: Let curiosity be your guide 
Take notes on the things that interest you.
#### Step 2: Identify lightening rods of thought
1. Bottom up: pick a topic and look at that note's local graph
2. Top down
3. Outside in
4. Chaos
- Use `query` - the built-in [Obsidian](Obsidian.md) function, rather than data view.

E.g., 

```dataview
TABLE tags as Tags
FROM #PKM AND -"Daily" AND -"Templates"
```

#### Chaos
Use smart random notes!
