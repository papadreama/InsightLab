Welcome to my published working notes. This is a space where I share notes and writing related to my work, my personal projects, and other interests. Some of these notes are organized into curricula for the [[university courses]] or [[workshops]] I teach, some are collected in [[maps of content]] while (many) others are less well-formed or in-progress. 

I'm currently working on a graduate certificate in applied mindfulness through [West Chester University](https://www.wcupa.edu/healthSciences/contemplativeStudies/), so I've been writing a lot about mindfulness practice, theory, and education. Most of that writing is part of a [[A Course on Contemplative Practices|course on contemplative practices]] I'll be teaching Fall of 2024. 

Notes for all of my math courses live on a separate site: [We All Do Math](https://wealldomath.com). There you'll find a digital textbook containing notes for the standard math courses I teach, handwritten notes, suggestions for how to learn math most effectively, as well as notes on mathematics and music.  

If you find any errors or issues, or have any comments, questions, or concerns, [please let me know!](mailto:papadopoulos.dimitri@gmail.com)
