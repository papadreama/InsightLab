Welcome to my published working notes. This is a space where I share notes related to both my work and to my personal projects and interests. Some of these notes are organized into curricula for [[university courses]] or [[workshops]] I teach, some are collected in [[maps of content]], while (many) others are less well-formed or in-progress. If you find any errors or issues, or have any comments, questions, or concerns, [please let me know!](mailto:papadopoulos.dimitri@gmail.com)
