## Having Mode vs. Being Mode

---

### Having Mode

+ Orientation toward life that prioritizes and values **possession** and **acquisition**
	+ Not limited to material goods: status, title, social capital, skill, etc.
+ **Instrumentalist** orientation
	+ Treating things as means to an end - including people
	+ Kant was one of the early European philosophers to argue that people should never be treated merely as means to an end (always as an end in themselves)
+ Fromm: having mode is largely a product of consumerist society 
	+ We are encouraged to accumulate wealth and power. 
	+ It is through acquisition that we measure our success and self-worth.

---

The nature of the having mode of existence follows from the nature of private property. In this mode of existence all that matters is my acquisition of property and my unlimited right to keep what I have acquired. The having mode excludes others; it does not require any further effort on my part to keep my property or to make productive use of it. The Buddha has described this mode of behavior as craving, the Jewish and Christian religions as coveting; it transforms everybody and everything into something ….. subject to another’s power

---

#### Examples

- Measuring one's self worth by how many degrees they have and from which institutions. 
- Feeling a sense of ownership over their friends and romantic partners. 
- Constantly comparing oneself to others in terms of beauty, perceived successes, etc. 
- Other examples?

---

### Being Mode

+ An approach to life that focuses on presence, process, and experience. 
+ Inherently **anti-instrumentalist** 
	+ Pursuit of goods for their own sake
+ Fromm: the being mode is more authentic and more fulfilling, leading to healthier relationships, a sense of connection to the present moment, and a general ease of being. 
	+ *"The anxiety and insecurity engendered by the danger of losing what one has are absent in the being mode. If I am who I am and not what I have, nobody can deprive me of or threaten my security and my sense of identity. My center is within myself; my capacity for being and for expressing my essential powers is part of my character structure and depends on me."*

---

#### Examples

- Defining vocational/professional success by how fulfilling one's work is, how much work-life balance they have, and the relationships they cultivate through their work. 
- Seeking deep connection in relationships in which one doesn't feel the need to control or change the other, valuing mutual growth (I like the term inter-independent).
- Prioritizing the joy of the process over the results.

## Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

---

### D-Needs and B-Needs

+ Deficiency-needs arise from a sense of deficiency.
	+ Include essential needs for survival like safety, food, shelter, love, and esteem
	+ Safety and security
+ Being-needs are motivated by the desire to grow, to become self-actualized, to connect with one's work and others, to find meaning and purpose. 
	+ Fulfilling one's potential for its own sake
	+ Anti-instrumentalist

---

## Revisiting the I AM Exercise

Go back through your I AM's and categorize them as belonging to having mode and being mode. 

---

## Meditation

Inquiry Practice: "What is it like to be you?"

+ Idea: let the subconscious work on the question
	+ Inspired by Zen Koan practice
	+ Drop the question into the mind and let it work on you rather than the other way around

---

### An Updated Model

+ Maslow never represented his hierarchy as a pyramid
	+ His view of human development was much more dynamic
	+ We're always in a state of becoming (Aristotle said something similar)
	+ We often take a few steps forward and a couple steps back
+ Scott Barry Kaufman offers a new model.
	+ Life is more of an ocean than a trek up a mountain
	+ "Life is a garden, not a road. We enter and exit through the same gate. Wandering, where we go matters less than what we notice." - Vonnegut
	+ We navigate life in a sailboat

## Reflection
Take some time to identify the describe what, for you, makes up each layer or component of the sailboat, sea, and sky.
- Which are B-needs and which are D-needs?
- Do you view purpose, love, and exploration through the having-mode lens, the being-mode lens, or a combination?
- What, if anything, separates your boat as it is from your ideal sailboat?

---

## Light and Dark Triads

Let's take the [test](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/lighttriadscale/). 

---

### Dark Triad

![[DarkTriad.png]]

- **Machiavellianism**: willingness to deceive and manipulate to get one's way (at any cost)
- **Grandiose narcissism**: pattern of inflated self-importance, feelings of superiority, and the need to be admired by others
- **Psychopathy**: callousness, detachment, absence of empathy

---

### Light Triad

![[LightTriad.png]]

- **Kantianism**: counterpart to Machiavellianism
	- "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end."
- **Humanism**: recognizing and valuing the innate dignity and worth of every individual
- **Faith in Humanity**: belief that humans are fundamentally good

---

### Reflection

- How do the two triads fit into the having-mode/being-mode framework?
- What do you make of your results from the test?
