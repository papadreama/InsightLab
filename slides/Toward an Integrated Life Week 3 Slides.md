# Knowledge

---

## Plato's Cave

- Plato's allegory of the cave is about the **emergence from ignorance into enlightenment** (knowledge/wisdom). 
+ Group of people, isolated from birth in a cave
+ Bound so that they can see little of their surroundings save for a cave wall
	+ On that wall, shadows, created by people/beings behind a wall, move about.

- Knowing nothing else, they assume this play of shadows is all there is of reality. 
+ One day, the chains are removed from one of the cave prisoners
+ Emergence into the sunlight is jarring
	+ Realization: whole world was just a play of light and shadow - an illusion
+ Over time he adjusts
	+ Sees in 3D
	+ The sun is what makes all that he sees visible
+ Returns to cave to tell others
	+ Unable to communicate what he saw outside 
	+ Others assume there's something wrong with him

### Discussion: Some Interpretations

- Death of Socrates
	- Sentenced to death for sharing wisdom and insights
- Meditative insight
	- Shifts in perception
- Knowledge that changes us
	- More than just propositional knowledge
- Digitally mediated lives
- **Others?**

---

## Propositional Knowledge

+ We tend to privilege **propositional knowledge:** knowledge *that a given proposition is true*
	+ T/F: A cat has nine lives. 
	+ T/F: Cats are allergic to poinsettias
	+ T/F A triangle has three sides
	+ T/F: Last summer, you travelled to Spain
+ Types of propositional knowledge: logical, semantic, systemic, empirical,...
+ Non-propositional knowledge
	+ Procedural: e.g., how to ride a bike
	+ Perspectival
+ **Others?**

---

### Beyond Propositional Knowledge

+ Paradigms: Thomas Kuhn and the structure of scientific revolution
	+ A community of individuals united by shared assumptions, values, practices, and languages
	+ Within a paradigm, certain propositions emerge as "established knowledge" not because they perfectly mirror an independent reality, but because they are products of the community's ongoing conversations, negotiations, and cultural influences
+ Knowledge as a product of social processes & relational praxis
	+ Active engagement in social and practical contexts as the primary means of generating and understanding knowledge

# Conscious Experience

---

## What is it like to be a bat? - Thomas Nagel

- Many attempts to explain consciousness are too reductionist.
	+ Fail to account for nature of subjective experience
	+ Knowledge that brain state X correspond to subjective experience Y doesn't provide an account of *what it is like* to experience Y
+ Subjective character of experience
	+ "an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism - something it is like for the organism."
	+ Someone/thing is conscious = there is something it is like to be that person/thing. 
		+ There isn't *something it is like to be* a rock.
		+ *There is something it is like* to be a cow. 

---

- Bats experience the world through *echolocation*, a sense that is fundamentally different from human vision. 
	+ We can't grasp what it is like to experience the world through echolocation
	+ All we do is map our experience of consciousness onto the compatible aspects of a bat's anatomy
		+ We can probably imagine flying and seeing from that perspective
+ Not arguing against the existence of a relationship between the mind (consciousness) and the brain
	+ Nor that the source of consciousness must be supernatural. 
	+ Suggesting that the nature of subjective experience may never be fully knowable, especially through a reductionist lens. 

---

### Qualia

+ Philosophers of mind use the term *qualia* to refer "to the introspectively accessible, phenomenal aspects of our mental lives." 
+ Qualia are subjective, qualitative state 
	+ The "what it is like" to have a certain experience 
		+ Seeing the color red
		+ Feeling angry
		+ Smelling a rose. 

---

### Thought-perception as a sense

+ We've been talking a lot about knowledge today
+ Can we talk about knowledge with discussing **thinking**?
+ In early Buddhist discourse, thought-perception is the sixth sense.
	+ Just as our eyes grant us visual-perception, and our ears grant us auditory-perception, our minds can perceive thoughts
		+ We may have already noticed that we can know that we're thinking
+ What is the nature of thought, not in terms of it neurological/physiological correlates, but in terms of our first-person, subjective experience?
	+ Exploration: meditation on thoughts
