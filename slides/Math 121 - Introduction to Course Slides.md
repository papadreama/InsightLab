## Some Notes on Studying

---

### Culture Shock

+  For most of us, our high school teachers...
	+ 👩‍🏫 had training in how to teach (and oversight)
	+ ❗️primary responsibility was their teaching
	+ ⏳ saw us five days a week
	+ 📝 held us accountable for missing work
+ Most college professors...
	+ 🏋️ are trained in their discipline
	+ 💼 have many responsibilities outside of teaching
	+ ⏳ see us at most three or four days a week
	+ 🙇‍♀️ shift the responsibility to us to stay on top of our work

---

#### Implications

+ We get to learn from true experts in their field(s) who...
	+ 🎖️ want to see us succeed (and contribute to their field)
	+ 🫶 love to talk with students about their discipline
	+ 🏢 hold regular office hours
+ It's our responsibility to...
	+ ⏰ practice good time management
	+ 📱 reach out for help and advice
	+ 👋🏼 show up to office hours and make connections

---

### Study smarter, not harder

- Let's start with two *case studies* from my calculus courses last year
	- We'll call them Peter and Alice
- Both students were...
	- 💪 hard-working
	- 👁️ engaged
	- ⏲️ came to class consistently and did work on time
	- 📚 cared about their grades

---

#### Case 1: Peter

+ ✅ Got an A in Calc 1
+ ✅ Got an A in Calc 2
+ ⬇️ Got a B- in Calc 3 (really calc 4)
+ 😰 Stressed the whole time

#### Case 2: Alice
+ ⚠️ Started off with a C- in Calc 1
+ 🚀 All of a sudden, got high A's on everything
+ ⛵️ Continued to get A's in the rest of the courses

---

#### Case 1: Peter

+ 🧠 Attempted to **memorize** every problem
+ 😩 Spent hours and hours at the MRC
+ 🙀 Panicked when plans changed

#### Case 2: Alice

+ ❓"What are you doing differently?"
+ 📑 Looking over notes **before** class
+ 👍🏼 Spent less time overall

---

### Takeaways

+ ⚡️ **Priming** our minds for learning by looking ahead
+ 👟 Practice the skills we want to get good at
	+ 🚫 Not memorizing specific examples, but problem-solving
	+ 🧪 Practice for tests by **testing yourself** 
+ 🪐 Space repetition over cramming 

---

#### Learn how to learn

+ ☹️ Most of us were never taught **[how to study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0&t=322s)** 
	+ 🛞 We spin our wheels with inefficient study habits
		+ 👿 Highlighting
		+ ♻️ Redoing the same problems or copying notes
+ 📖 Be open to [rethinking how you study/learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddq8JIMhz7c&t=1s&pp=ygURaHViZXJtYW4gbGVhcm5pbmc%3D) 
+ 🏋️‍♀️ Athletes have personal trainers; singers/actors have vocal coaches
	+ 🌟 You have access to academic personal trainers here 
		+ 💖 CLASS, ACE, MRC, Writing Center,...
+ 🚫 **Don't waste time in class copying every word or taking pictures of every page.**
	+ 🤔 Class time is for thinking, asking questions, doing problems

---

#### One example: recalling vs recognizing

+ 😐 We often conflate **recollection** & **recognition**
+ ❓Which is harder: recognizing a word in a foreign language OR coming up with a work for something you want to say in that language?
+ ❓Which is harder: preparing for a quiz or preparing for a presentation?
+ ✅ One of the most well-validated strategies for learning is **[active recall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FatnXnlwAc4&t=145s&pp=ygUNYWN0aXZlIHJlY2FsbA%3D%3D)** 

---

#### Some concrete suggestions

+ 🧐 Test yourself regularly
	+ 📒 Put away your note book and write down what you remember
	+ ✍🏼 Try writing your own problems
	+ ⏲️ Set up "test conditions" for yourself
+ 🗣️ Practice explaining problems or concepts to your friends
+ 📝 Try writing your own problems from each section
+ 📋 Keep lists of concepts/problem-types you struggle with
+ ⛏️ Use tutoring services to uncover roots of misunderstanding (not just getting specific problems done)

---

### Learning Communities: one more case study

+ 🧱 I hit a brick wall junior year of undergrad
+ 💡 Realized I never learned how to really study
+ 🔍 Found *my learning tribe*
+ 🔥 Mixed academic + social: 
	+ 👨🏻‍🏫 get together and take turns doing problems on the board
+ 🎉 Changed my life

---

### There are no "math people"

+ 🐣 Nobody is **born** a math person
+ 🔔 We're all in the middle of the bell curve
	+ 🧮 If you can do even basic algebra, you know more math than most people who've ever lived
+ 🎶 Just like how there are no "music people"
	+ 🎹 More people with perfect pitch in countries that speak *tonal* languages
+ 🪴 **Growth mindset is everything**
