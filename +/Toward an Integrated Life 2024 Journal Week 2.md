This week, our theme was *having and being* inspired largely by the works of Fromm and Maslow. We began by discussing student's reflections on the their home practice assignments. I was amazed by some of their responses. 

On the subject of novel experiences (the beginner's mind assignment), one student commented that she never noticed her hand position when holding a kitchen knife to chop vegetables. Another remarked that he struggled with the assignment, but then proceeded to describe the way it feels to stand at the top of one of our buildings with a large open stairwell - so, he had a very interesting observation about his inner state.

With regard to meditation, several student noted their struggles, but appreciated the guided practices. A couple noted that they used the practices before important meetings or interviews to positive effect. 

We then spent some time discussing the having mode and being mode as described by Fromm, coming up with our own examples for each. Again, students came up with some really interesting examples, many of which related to their own lived experiences. I peppered in my own personal anecdotes. 

We then revisited their responses to the I AM exercise. One particularly fruitful discussion followed a student who shared that he described himself as "stubborn." Another student responded that maybe he's just passionate and then shared her experiences being told she was stubborn when she engaged passionately. This led to a nuance discussion of the light and dark sides of our personality traits. 

Our main meditation practice for the evening was an inquiry practice I came up with. I instructed students to "drop in the question: *what is it like to be me?* In my guidance, I reminded them not to think about the question analytically, but to "let the question work on them." Once again, we had great discussion. 

One student remarked that she mostly experienced light and color - lots of yellows and oranges. Another found her thoughts circled around how she is perceived by others. I interjected at one point to reiterated that what's of interest, what we were observing, was how the mind reacted in the moment; we weren't after some universal, perennial answer to the question. 

Overall, I think this class went really well.
