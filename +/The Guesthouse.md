# The Guesthouse

This being human is a guest house.  
Every day a new arrival.  

A joy, a depression, a meanness,   
some momentary awareness comes   
as an unexpected visitor.  

Welcome and entertain them all!   
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,    
who violently sweep your house   
empty of its furniture,   
still, treat every guest honorably.   
He may be clearing you out   
for some new delight.  

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,   
meet them at the door laughing,   
and invite them in.  

Be grateful for whoever comes,   
because each has been sent   
as a guide from beyond.
