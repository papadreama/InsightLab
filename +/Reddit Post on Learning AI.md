Hey there,
I'm an engineer, tech-lead, CTO so I feel you. I left my job a few months ago, so I've had time to play around, and do some small project stuff. Here's some advice I gave to a SWE friend, but I think it's high-level enough to be useful to you too:

It's super tough to try to fit in learning when you have a Full-Time job so here are some thoughts

•	⁠One day a week, or even just half a day use Cursor.ai to write code, or turn on co-pilot with visual-code (openai/gpt or anthropic/claude are fine).
	⁠•	⁠If you're not a programmer: that's okay. Open some code and just ask questions about what it's doing and how the software works. Try v0 https://v0.dev/ to generate software for you.
•	⁠Use one of the chat systems while learning AI to ask questions. (chatgpt, https://claude.ai).
•	⁠Go through a short (<2hrs) prompt engineering course like https://www.coursera.org/projects/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers-project . There are lots of prompt engineering videos on youtube as well.
•	⁠Find a 15min youtube video AI overview you like (such as Tina Huang's How To Self Study AI FAST )
•	⁠When doing web searches for anything research-y or not super specific use (https://you.com/, https://perplexity.ai)
•	⁠If you can carve out 2-3 hours a week, come up with a fun project you think would be good try in python.
	⁠•	⁠Use https://colab.research.google.com/ or jupyter notebooks to play around in python (free GPUs help)
•	⁠AI is a super broad area, once you pick a project that will help you focus on what you want to learn. I found medium articles often helpful (https://medium.com/) and Reddit (of course).
•	⁠Check on a source of news once a week. Can be whatever you find and interesting. This could be a weekly mailing list, youtube subscription, linkedin newsletter, etc. and these vary from generic industry news, to dev tools. I'm thinking of:
	⁠•	⁠A bunch of channels reddit discussion
	⁠•	⁠Matthew Berman Exciting Industry News, a bit long (~45m)
	⁠•	⁠AI, MLOps, and Robotics

Alright, hope that's useful. Please let me know what worked and didn't...

Also, what would you like to know? What's hard or confusing about learning? Is it just keeping up-to-date on tools, news, or trying to dig into a particular thing?

Thanks, /charles
