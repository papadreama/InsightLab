### Protected Time 
Designating specific times each week for important activities, such as writing or exercise, that should not be interrupted. 

### Daily Themes
Assigning particular focuses to different days of the week, like having no meetings on Mondays to allow for deep work or designating certain days for specific roles or tasks. 

### Regular Rules and Limits 
Establishing consistent practices or boundaries to manage time effectively, such as limiting the number of meetings in a day or scheduling lighter workdays. Categories and Bullet Points: Organizing the weekly template in a clear format, often as a bulleted list, that outlines the elements of an ideal week.
