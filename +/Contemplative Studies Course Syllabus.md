## Weekly Practices
My goal is to keep the work you have to do each week to, *at most*, 90 minutes. Though the specific practices, journaling prompts, reflection assignments, and readings will vary, this is a rough outline of our weekly workload.
### Journaling and Other Reflection Assignments (15 - 20 minutes)
Each week, you'll reflect on the readings, class discussions, and - most importantly - your experiences with the contemplative practices for that week. 
### Mindful Pauses (1 minute x 5 times/week)
Throughout the week, pause for one minute. Look away from your screen or book, and simply take note of what that moment is like. What are you thinking? What's your general mood? Are you rushing into the next moment? Dwelling on a past experience? Feeling stressed? Joyful? Tired? What do you notice in your environment?

Quickly jot down your observations. 
### Meditation + Rapid Logging (At least 5mins x 4 times/week = 20+ mins)
Each week we'll add a new meditation practice. You should practice the new one at least once outside of class, and then feel free to mix and match any of the practices from previous weeks. You don't need to do more than five minutes at a time, but I encourage you to try sitting longer. I will be holding 30-minutes Zoom sessions once a week to help support your practice. 

### Contemplations + Reflections (20 - 30 minutes)
To complement our meditation practice, we'll have specific contemplations and reflections each week. Because these may be very personal in nature, I will make submission for these optional. We'll discuss these in class, but you can be as specific as is comfortable when reporting on your experiences and findings. 

### Reading/Watching/Listening (15 - 20 minutes)
Most of the reading materials and other media are *suggested,* but not required. On the course website, I'll provide summaries for the core ideas that week, which shouldn't take more than 10 - 15 minutes. Beyond that, you can read, watch, or listen to anything that interests you. In other words, don't feel like you have to consume all the suggested media. 

## Schedule
All of the materials for the course are organized into ten themes/modules on the course website. 

Below is an outline of the course. You'll find summaries of the core concepts and links to suggested media there.

- **Novel Observations of Everyday Experiences:** Three times during the week, pick an everyday object, environment, or experience (your room, a classroom, walking, talking to a friend, etc.) and jot down at least two novel observations - things you've never noticed before.
- **Meditation:** Practice the six anchors meditation we did in class at least three times this week. Links to the guidance for that practice are on the course website. You may also experiment with other meditations. After each meditation, rapid log your experience of the meditation: thoughts, emotions, sensations, how you feel before vs after, etc. You don't have to share these with me.
