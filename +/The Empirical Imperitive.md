This course is an example of what we call "critical first-person learning:" critical, because in many forms of first-person learning in the contexts of religion, one must suspend critical judgment and believe in the various truths of the tradition. 

There is an important place for this form of "committed" first-person learning in our private lives, but should be careful to not require that kind of commitment in a secular university.

We will observe how our minds and bodies work while deline unaries extile medianie techniques

We will critically discuss these texts in light of our experiences in the meditation laboratory.

Without a doubt, this kind of novel pedagogy is not to tean participate ieason Meat is edition
