## Overview

This course is designed for students to explore and develop a personal ecology of contemplative practices aimed at integrating their academic and professional journeys with their personal values and aspirations. Through a comprehensive curriculum that blends theory, practice, and reflection, students will critically examine their values, motivations, mental models, and habits of mind. 

Each week, we will focus on different contemplative practices, their historical contexts, theoretical foundations, underlying philosophies, and practical applications in daily life. Our readings will include ancient and modern manuals of practice coupled with scientific literature on the benefits of these practices, as well as poetry and selected readings from psychology and philosophy. Students will be encouraged to experiment with meditation, journaling, creative expression, and intentional dialogue as they deepen their self-understanding and define a personal vision of self-actualization.

## Structure + Aim
This course is broken down into ten modules, each containing a few core ideas/concepts, in-class activities and discussions, and home practices. The readings and other media I've included throughout are there to support our explorations by providing useful language, scientific foundations, historical context, and useful frameworks. 

This doesn't mean that we're here to learn facts and analyze texts as we might in a traditional literature or philosophy course. This course is about you, and the most important material is your unique, subjective experience. If something you read or watch sparks something in you, sheds light on an aspect of your life that feels interesting or challenging or helpful, or prompts a meaningful reflection, great! If not, then feel free to let it go. 

I hope that these ideas and practices will serve as tools that you can bring to bear on your pursuit of self-knowledge. In my experience, there's great delight in finding a phrase or story or image that reveals something I felt I knew all along. 

> *No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge.* - **Kahlil Gibran**

## Weekly Practices
My goal is to keep the work you have to do each week to, *at most*, 2 hours. Though the specific practices, journaling prompts, reflection assignments, and readings will vary, this is a rough outline of our weekly workload.

### Journaling and Other Reflection Assignments (20 - 30 minutes)
Each week, you'll reflect on the readings, class discussions, and - most importantly - your experiences with the contemplative practices for that week. 

### Mindful Pauses (1 minute x 5 times/week)
Throughout the week, pause for one minute. Look away from your screen or book, and simply take note of what that moment is like. What are you thinking? What's your general mood? Are you rushing into the next moment? Dwelling on a past experience? Feeling stressed? Joyful? Tired? What do you notice in your environment?

Quickly jot down your observations. 

### Meditation + Rapid Logging (At least 5mins x 4 times/week = 20+ mins)
Each week we'll add a new meditation practice. You should practice the new one at least once outside of class, and then feel free to mix and match any of the practices from previous weeks. You don't need to do more than five minutes at a time, but I encourage you to try sitting longer. I will be holding 30-minutes Zoom sessions once a week to help support your practice. 

### Contemplations + Reflections (20 - 30 minutes)
To complement our meditation practice, we'll have specific contemplations and reflections each week. Because these may be very personal in nature, I will make submission for these optional. We'll discuss these in class, but you can be as specific as is comfortable when reporting on your experiences and findings. 

### Reading/Watching/Listening (15 - 30 minutes)
Most of the reading materials and other media are *suggested,* but not required. On the course website, I'll provide summaries for the core ideas that week, which shouldn't take more than 10 - 15 minutes. Beyond that, you can read, watch, or listen to anything that interests you. In other words, don't feel like you have to consume all the suggested media. 

## Schedule
All of the materials for the course are organized into ten themes/modules on the course website. 

Below is an outline of the course. You'll find summaries of the core concepts and links to suggested media there.

## Grading
Your grade for the course will depend on the following elements: 

| Component                          | Grade Percentage |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Participation                      | 10%              |
| Journals                           | 20%              |
| Reflection/Contemplation Activites | 20%              |
| Mindfulness Rapid Logs             | 20%              |
| Final Project                      | 30%              |

### Participation
Given the reflective, collaborative, and discussion-based nature of this course, I expect student to attend every class, prepared to participate and share their work from the previous week. Of course, things come up! So, I just ask that you let me know in advance if you won't be able to make it so we can make alternate arrangements for your participation that week. 

### Journals
Your weekly journals should take not more that 20 - 30 minutes. Around 200 - 300 words. 

### Reflection/Contemplation Activities
We'll start most of these in class together, so your homework will just be to expand on and clarify what you started in class. If anything comes up you feel is too personal to share, you can forgo submitting this work and instead write about it in your journal for that week. 

### Mindfulness Rapid Logs
You'll submit your rapid logs from meditations and other mindfulness activities each week as part of your journal entries. These can be short bulleted lists. As with the reflection/contemplation activities, feel free to redact anything that you don't feel comfortable sharing.

### Final Project
The final project will be a synthesis of everything you've done all term. I'd advise keeping one long running document all term from which you can just copy-paste your weekly submissions.
