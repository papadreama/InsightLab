Hello Team!

I'm glad to have you all teaching Math 121 with me this quarter. For those who have taught coordinated sections of this course in the past, much of this will be familiar to you. 

Here's a breakdown of the course, what I will provide, and what is expected of you. 

### My part
- **Syllabus:** see the attached
- **WebWork:** I will provide a set of links to the homework assignments along with instructions for how to add them to your Blackboard pages. Once you do so, students' grades on the homework will be automatically synced to your Blackboard grade book. Please let students know that the grade they see in the grade book will continue to update until the due date (they always panic when they see a low score after completing a couple problems).
- **Exams:** I will write the two midterms and final. You'll receive drafts of these exams about 5 or 6 days before the exam date for review and feedback. 
	- I will also provide rubrics for grading these exams.
- **Online Resources:** We do not require a textbook for this course. However, we do have a set of practice problems that serve as a framework and basis for the quizzes and exams. You can use these in class as you see fit. I expect that an attentive student will be able to do at least the first 75% of each set. The last few problems on most of these sets are *challenge problems* that I expect only the A+ students to be able to do on their own. Please let students know that they are not going to be tested on those tricky/proof-based problems. I will also share a couple of freely available online resources that students may use for reference in lieu of a textbook. 
	- **Practice Problems:** The full set of practice problems is available [here](https://www.math.drexel.edu/classes/Calculus/)
	- [**Paul's Online Notes**](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu): This is a phenomenal resource that serves as an online textbook. The one draw back is that the delineation between courses is based on a semester school schedule. 
	- **[My Online Notes](https://www.wealldomath.com/calculus/limits/introduction/):** I've been working on compiling my lecture notes into a complete course. It's very much a work in progress, but it follows the order of our practice sets, so I plan to share it with my students.
		- You can also find my complete handwritten lecture notes from last year [here](https://www.wealldomath.com/documents/handwritten/calculus/CompleteArchive.pdf)

### Your part
- **Lectures:** How you run your lectures is totally up to you. I often incorporate group work and am happy to share all of the worksheets I use in class. 
- **Quizzes:** You will be responsible for writing and grading a total of six quizzes, the lowest of which will be dropped. You may do so on any day of the week, but I ask that you not give quizzes on the same week as the midterms (and use the class before each exam to review). Please do not give more than six quizzes. I'm happy to share my quizzes (past and present). 
- **Proctoring & Grading Exams:** We will be giving exams together during the common exam time. I will provide rubrics for grading the midterm and final exams. You will enter these in your own grade books on Blackboard. Please try to have the exams graded within one week of the exam date. I'll collect all of the grades at the end of the quarter for the department's records.


That should be all for now. I'll include this email as a PDF attachment for your reference. 

When you have a moment, please send me your full-name email address (e.g., mine is dimitrios.papapadopoulos@drexel.edu) so I can set you up to access to WebWork through Blackboard. Until I do so, you’ll receive an error when you try to log in.

Let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns. 

Thank you,  
D.
